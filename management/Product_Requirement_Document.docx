Project Requirement Document: Face Detection and Recognition System

Introduction
The Face Detection and Recognition System is a software program designed to detect human faces in live video streams and compare them with known faces in a database.
The system will be developed using Python programming language and OpenCV and dlib libraries.
The system will be capable of running on a high-end CPU and GPU system.
The primary objective of the system is to provide accurate face detection and recognition results in real-time.

Functional Requirements
The system should be able to capture live video streams from a webcam or any other video source.
The system should be able to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
The system should be able to compare the detected faces with known faces in a database.
The system should be able to identify unknown faces and save them in a directory named "Unknown Faces".
The system should be able to display the live video stream in a window with a size of 25% of the screen.
The system should be able to display the name of the detected face along with the time of appearance in the video.
The system should be able to save the known faces with their respective names and timestamps in a directory named "Known Faces".
The system should be able to save the unknown faces with a random ID as their names in a directory named "Unknown Faces".
The system should be able to display the top 5 matches for the unknown face if there is no match with the known faces.
The system should be able to save the unknown faces with their respective match percentage in a directory named "Unknown Faces".

Non-functional Requirements
The system should be able to provide accurate face detection and recognition results in real-time with a minimum delay of 1 second.
The system should be able to handle multiple faces in a video stream simultaneously.
The system should be able to store and retrieve the faces and their respective details efficiently.
The system should have a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and error messages.
The system should be easy to install and run on a high-end CPU and GPU system.

Development Environment
The system will be developed using Python 3.8 or above.
The system will use OpenCV and dlib libraries for image processing and face detection and recognition.
The system will use Tkinter or PyQt for creating the user interface.
The system will be developed and tested on a high-end CPU and GPU system with a minimum of 8 GB RAM and 1 TB storage.
The system will be developed on a Windows operating system.

Testing Requirements
The system will be tested using various test cases to ensure its functionality and accuracy.
The system will be tested for its ability to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
The system will be tested for its ability to store and retrieve faces and their respective details efficiently.
The system will be tested for its ability to handle multiple faces in a video stream simultaneously.
The system will be tested for its user interface and user-friendliness.
The system will be tested for its ability to run on a high-end CPU and GPU system with a minimum of 8 GB RAM and 1 TB storage.

Deployment and Maintenance
The system will be deployed on a high-end CPU and GPU system with a minimum of 8 GB RAM and 1 TB storage.
The system will have an installer to simplify the deployment process.
The system will have clear documentation and user manuals for users to refer to.
The system will have a maintenance plan to ensure its smooth operation and continued development.
