Project Proposal: Face Detection and Recognition

Introduction:
Facial recognition technology is becoming more and more prevalent in various applications, such as security systems, social media platforms, and virtual reality. The purpose of this project is to develop a face detection and recognition system using Python and open-source libraries such as OpenCV and dlib. The system will be able to detect faces in a live video stream, compare them to a database of known faces, and identify them if a match is found.

Objectives:
The objectives of this project are as follows:
Develop a face detection algorithm using OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect faces in a live video stream.
Develop a face recognition algorithm using dlib and face encodings to compare detected faces to a database of known faces.
Create a user interface that displays the video stream with detected faces highlighted and the names of matched known faces displayed next to them.
Implement a system for saving images of unknown faces that are not recognized in the known_faces or unknown_faces directories, along with their timestamp and percentage match.
Optimize the face detection and recognition algorithms for real-time performance on a variety of hardware configurations.

Methodology:
The project will be implemented using the following methodology:
Research and experimentation with OpenCV and dlib to develop the face detection and recognition algorithms.
Develop a Python script to integrate the face detection and recognition algorithms, and display the results in a user interface.
Implement the system for saving images of unknown faces and their match percentage.
Optimize the performance of the algorithms and test them on different hardware configurations.
Document the project and create a user manual for the system.

Expected Outcomes:
The expected outcomes of this project are:
A face detection and recognition system that can accurately detect and recognize faces in a live video stream.
A user interface that displays the video stream with detected faces highlighted and the names of matched known faces displayed next to them.
An image database of unknown faces with their timestamp and percentage match.
A system that can be used for security purposes or other applications where facial recognition is useful.
Documentation and a user manual for the system.

Conclusion:
This project will develop a face detection and recognition system using open-source libraries and Python. The system will be able to accurately detect and recognize faces in a live video stream, and save images of unknown faces that are not recognized. The system will be useful for security purposes or other applications where facial recognition is needed.
